This is a minimal Webpack example with hot reload.  
To start the development server, type:

    npm install
    npm start

Open http://localhost:8080/ and start editing index.js, greeter.js or style.scss and see how the changes apply without hitting f5 in the browser.

## What's inside?

 - [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com)
 - [PUG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug) (formerly [jade](http://jade-lang.com), it was renamed due to trademark issues)
 - [Babel](http://babeljs.io) (use modern JavaScript today)
 - [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer)

## What's missing?

 - no production build yet (coming soon ☺)

## Why?

This is a basic Webpack setup that uses the preprocessors that I usually use in my [demos](https://codepen.io/terabaud) at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).
